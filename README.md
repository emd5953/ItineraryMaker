## Technical Architecture

1. **Frontend**  
   - **React** with **Next.js** for server-side rendering (SSR).  
   - **TypeScript** to ensure type safety and better tooling.  
   - **Redux** for state management (scalable, industry-standard).  
   - **Tailwind CSS** (or Material UI/Chakra UI) for rapid, responsive UI development.

2. **Backend**  
   - **Node.js** for the runtime environment.  
   - **Express.js** for a lightweight, flexible REST API (though NestJS is also a viable alternative).  
   - **NextAuth.js** for user authentication (Google, email/password, etc.).

3. **Database**  
   - **MongoDB** for a flexible, document-based approach.  
   - Potential integration libraries: **Mongoose** or **Prisma** (MongoDB connector).  
   - Stores user profiles, itineraries, collaboration records, etc.

4. **Deployment & DevOps** (TBA)  
   - Could leverage services like **Vercel** for the Next.js frontend, **Render** or **Heroku** for the Node/Express backend, and **MongoDB Atlas** for hosted database.  
   - Optionally, use **Docker** for containerization and consistent environment setup.
